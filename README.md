  VFD-WCN
=========

VFD-WCN is a Python library dedicated for driving multiple Wincor Nixdorf (WN) Point of Sale USB VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display), such as BA-63 USB.
This library should be compatible with any WN BA-6x USB VFD.

Please note that VFD-WCN is mainly an extension of VFD-POS library from https://github.com/antonio-fr/VFDPoS
Many thanks to Antoine Ferron for the work.

Provides high level abstraction to use Wincor Nixdorf Point of Sale VFD USB

* identification of each display as well as information on type and capability (2 ou 4 lines of display)
* Easy to use and handle, play with your VFD in no time
* Cross-platform code and dependencies
* Full python code to access VFD through USB
* Character encoding automatic conversion
* limited python dependencies (some provided in zip)


## Dependencies

This library needs PyUSB, it can work on mutiple OS platform. PyUSB always requires libusb.

PyUSB is installed through `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyusb>`:

    pip install pyusb

### Linux

On Debian based distributions

	sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

On Fedora (replace `dnf` by `yum` for CentOS)

	sudo dnf install libusb-devel

### Windows

In windows you can use instead of this library : VFD-POS, frm which VFD-WCN is inspired but provides driver-less, null installation and platform specific access to a single VFD.
https://github.com/antonio-fr/VFD-POS


If you need universal and cross-platform Python code, you can still use this library. On Windows, this requires libusb-win32 driver installed and loaded for the WN VFD.
The easiest way is to get Zadig and to select libusb-win32 for the Diplay Interface of your WN VFD.
http://zadig.akeo.ie/ Then you need PyUSB (provided in zip release).

## Installing library

	pip install git+https://github.com/stephanemouton/VFD-WCN.git

## Usage

To use the library, add the following import in your code 

    from vfdpos import *

### API

#### Initialisation

A Factory pattern is used to create instances of multiple connected displays according to devices dicovered by libusb.
The kind of device to find can be specified as parameter of the factory (by default, BA63 2 lines displays).
The vfdpos.py define constants (BA63 & BA66) for display types which are USB product IDs

    factory=WincorNixdorfDisplayFactory()
    VFDs = factory.get_vfd_pos()
    MyVFD = VFDs[0]


#### Self-Test

Tell the VFD to perform self-test. You may need to initialize VFD again after do so.

    MyVFD.selftest()


#### Reset

Tell the VFD to perform a reboot. You need to initialize VFD again after do so.

    MyVFD.reset()


#### Set Charset

Set the VFD charset. See your WN operational manual documentation for char code.
During initialisation, WN VFD is automatically set up to 0x31 = Code Page 850. Don't change it unless you really have specific need, this would cause issues with write_msg function.

Character tables are available in :
http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/cae/servlet/contentblob/614268/publicationFile/60592/BA6x_Character_Appendix_english.pdf

    MyVFD.set_charset(CHARSET_CODE)


#### Clear Screen

Clear and erase the VFD screen.

    MyVFD.clearscreen()


#### Print Character

Print a character from its number at the cursor position

    MyVFD.printchr(CHAR_CODE)


#### Position Cursor

Change the position of the cursor to a given column and line. If 0 is provided for a parameter, no change is performed for it.

    MyVFD.poscur(LINE, COLUMN)


#### Write Message

Write a message to the VFD screen at the cursor position. This function uses automatic decoding of any unicode character. In case you provide direclty the string don't forget trailing u (  u"string" ). If you change the charset to another one, this function might bring some issues. You can use "\r" and "\n" inside the string to get line control.

    MyVFD.write_msg(MESSAGE_STRING)


#### Close Device

When python program stops, the display keep lighting. This command clears the display. Useful if you need to light off the VFD after using it.

    MyVFD.close()


**Form more details: see code in examples directory**


## Example :
The following example displays a basic text on a BA66 USB VFD, assuming only a single display is connected.

    from vfdpos import *

    factory=WincorNixdorfDisplayFactory()
    wnpos = factory.get_vfd_pos(BA66)
    wnpos.write_msg("Hello World !\r\nThat works :)")
    raw_input("PRESS ENTER TO EXIT")
